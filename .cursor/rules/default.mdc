Unless otherwise instructed:
- KISS - less code, simpler code please! as long as it achieves the end goal
- keep coding style and patterns consistent with the rest of the codebase, especially the file you are editing
- make reasonable assumptions

Unless absolutely necessary, give reasonable assmptions:
- Avoid code comments
- Avoid exception handling
- Avoid condition checks (nil, true, etc.)
- Avoid typeof / isArray etc., prefer to just assign the type when known
- Avoid very long single lines. Maximum of 120 characters per line

Before starting the task:
- Explore files symbols and do web searches as needed to gain context. YOU MUST HAVE 100% confidence in your answer.
- /go/pkg/mod contains all imported libraries source code
- wails/ is our local fork of the wails source code
- the root tmp/ dir can be used for any temporary files / builds / binaries (DO NOT place them in zettl/zettl)

During the task
- use pnpm
- THINK FAST GO FAST. No need to think in full sentences, keep commentary LEAN
- If you are to delete a file. Actually delete it! Do not just clear the contents or put some placeholder.
- DO NOT place files in src/components/ui. This is reserved for generated shadcn/ui components
- DO NOT run task build it's too slow. you may run lightweight go builds / frontend builds

After a task:
- Keep your commentary to a MINIMUM. At most a few short bullet points on the change
